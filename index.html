    <div class ="about-me__body">
        <p>Hi, my name is Codey Hutton I am a United States Marine Corps veteran turning software engineer. In the Marines I was an aircraft mechanic for life support systems.
            essential systems that kept aircrew alive, due to injuries I sustained in the Marines I could no longer work as a mechanic when I finished my 5-year contract. But I
            still had all the mental acuity and problem-solving skills of a maintenance technician experienced with working on several hundred-million-dollar military aircraft.</p>
        <p>This sort of mindset is something that is very valuable when I am designing, implementing, and delivering programs. The logical thinking involved in programming
            is extremely similar to the mindset of a software engineer, and so it was a very natural to switch from aircraft maintenance to computer science. My work experience in the
            US Marines has given me a work ethic that is highly desirable in a junior developer. I dive into my work with a single-minded tenacity, performing research
            and implementing technologies needed to fulfill the mission. The way I see it, it helps me to become a better engineer, as well as ramping up in productivity for the team.</p>
