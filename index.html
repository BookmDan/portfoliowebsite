        <p>Hi, my name is Daniel I am freshly graduating CS Degree holder ready to become a software engineer. In my previous work experience, ranging from HR, front desk, to QA, Aerospace

        <p>This sort of mindset is something that is very valuable when I am designing, implementing, and delivering production code. While problem-solving is something that I excel at,
            I am also not afraid to learn from others and take on new challenges. I am also a very quick learner, which is a highly desirable in a junior developer. I dive into my work with a 
            single-minded tenacity, performing research and implementing technologies needed to fulfill the mission. This not only helps me become a better engineer, but it also helps me understand
